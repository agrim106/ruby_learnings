# 2. Trees
# ● Concept:
# ○ ATreeisahierarchical data structure where elements are organized in a
# parent-child relationship.
# ○ Thetopmost element is called the root.
# ○ Eachelement (node) can have zero or more children.
# ● RubyImplementation:
# ○ Rubydoesn't have a built-in Tree class. However, you can implement a tree using
# other data structures like hashes or custom classes.
# # Example of a simple tree using a hash
tree = {
"root" => {
"child1" => {},
"child2" => {
"grandchild" => {}
}
}
}
# ● TypesofTrees:
# ○ Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children (left and right).
# ○ Binary Search Tree: A binary tree where the left subtree contains nodes with
# values less than the current node, and the right subtree contains nodes with values
# greater than the current node.
# ○ AVLTree: Aself-balancing binary search tree.
# ○ Red-Black Tree: Another self-balancing binary search tree.
# ● Applications:
# ○ File systems: Represent the hierarchical structure of files and directories.
# ○ Organizational charts: Model hierarchical relationships within an organization.
# ○ Decision trees: Used in machine learning for making predictions.
# ○ Datastructures: Implement efficient algorithms for searching, sorting, and inserting
# data.
# Key Points:
# ● Setsare ideal for collections where uniqueness and fast membership checks are crucial.
# ● Trees are valuable for representing hierarchical data and enabling efficient searching and
# sorting algorithms.0
